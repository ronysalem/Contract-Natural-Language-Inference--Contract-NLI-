# Project Name: Contract Natural Language Inference (Contract-NLI)

## Introduction

This project focuses on Natural Language Inference (NLI) applied to contract documents. NLI is a fundamental task in natural language processing where the goal is to determine the logical relationship between two given sentences: a "premise" and a "hypothesis." In the context of contract analysis, this task can help identify whether a hypothesis statement logically follows from the information in a contract.

## Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to create and evaluate models for Contract-NLI using transformer-based approaches. The project involves the following key steps:

### 1. Data Statistics and Preparation

- Data is collected and prepared for training, validation, and testing.
- JSON files containing contract data are converted into CSV format.
- The dataset is analyzed to understand its size, average document length, maximum and minimum document length, and label distribution.

### 2. Model Selection and Training

Two transformer-based models, Albert and RoBERTa, are chosen for the Contract-NLI task. These models are selected for their proven performance on NLI benchmarks and efficiency.

#### 2.1 Albert Model

- The `albert-base-v2` model and tokenizer are loaded.
- Data is tokenized, including separating the text and hypothesis using the `[sep]` token.
- A custom dataset is created for training and validation.
- The model is trained using training arguments and evaluated on both validation and test datasets.

#### 2.2 RoBERTa Model

- The `roberta-base` model and tokenizer are loaded.
- Data is tokenized similarly to the Albert model.
- A custom dataset is created for training and validation.
- The RoBERTa model is trained using training arguments and evaluated on both validation and test datasets.

### 3. Performance Analysis and Error Analysis

- Model performance is evaluated, and accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
- The project investigates cases where the models made incorrect predictions and attempts to identify patterns or challenges.

### 4. Recommendation Ideas

To enhance the performance of the models, the project recommends the following:

- **Ensemble of Models:** Combining multiple models with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve overall performance.
- **Adversarial Training:** Training the model on adversarial examples to improve its robustness and ability to handle variations in input data.

## Conclusion

The "Contract Natural Language Inference" project focuses on applying NLI techniques to contract documents, with the ultimate goal of improving understanding and analysis of contract language. The project explores two transformer-based models, Albert and RoBERTa, and offers insights into their performance, potential challenges, and recommendations for improvement.

By addressing the complexities and nuances of contract language, this project aims to contribute to the field of contract analysis and natural language understanding.
